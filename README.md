# Update 2020-01-08: This fork was merged into master

This fork was originally used to provide UPM support to NaughtyAttributes. The [official NaughtyAttributes repo](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes/tree/upm) now has UPM support, so this fork is now obsolete.

I won't be deleting this repo because people are using it in their projects and I don't want to break those. However, this fork will not be updated anymore. You should switch to the official repo.

Caveat: I'll be using non-master branches to make pull requests to the official repo. The master branch is frozen however.
